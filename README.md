## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was my first time using Qwik. I love the concept and the developer experience is quite a bit nicer than React. It was great using Signals for State Management. I'll be interested to see how this develops.

### Continued development

I wanted to give Qwik a shot to see if it's something I wanted to use for personal projects but I plan on learning React for future development.
