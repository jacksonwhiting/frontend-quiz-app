![Design preview for the Frontend quiz app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for purchasing this premium Frontend Mentor coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. These premium challenges are perfect portfolio pieces, so please feel free to use what you create in your portfolio to show others.

**To do this challenge, you need a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this quiz app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local `data.json` file, so use that to populate the content for the quizzes.

Your users should be able to:

- Select a quiz subject
- Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four
- See an error message when trying to submit an answer without making a selection
- See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer
- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the entire app only using their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Change the app's theme between light and dark

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided. We provide both Sketch and Figma versions of the design, so you can choose which tool you prefer to use. You can download the design file on the platform. **Please be sure not to share them with anyone else.** The design download comes with a `README.md` file as well to help you get set up.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project. Our fonts always come from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Separate the `starter-code` from the rest of this project and rename it to something meaningful for you. Initialize the codebase as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/). **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è: There are already a couple of `.gitignore` files in this project. Please do not remove them or change the content of the files. If you create a brand new project, please use the `.gitignore` files provided in your new codebase. This is to avoid the accidental upload of the design files to GitHub. With these premium challenges, please be sure not to share the design files in your GitHub repo. Thanks!**
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

## Submitting your solution

Submit your solution on the platform for the rest of the community to see. Follow our ["Complete guide to submitting solutions"](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) for tips on how to do this.

Remember, if you're looking for feedback on your solution, be sure to ask questions when submitting it. The more specific and detailed you are with your questions, the higher the chance you'll get valuable feedback from the community.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è: With these premium challenges, please be sure not to upload the design files to GitHub when you're submitting to the platform and sharing it around. If you've created a brand new project, the easiest way to do that is to copy across the `.gitignore` provided in this starter project.**

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of our [community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community). 
2. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor**, including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.
3. Share your solution on other social channels like LinkedIn.
4. Blog about your experience building your project. Writing about your workflow, technical choices, and talking through your code is a brilliant way to reinforce what you've learned. Great platforms to write on are [dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), and [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/).

We provide templates to help you share your solution once you've submitted it on the platform. Please do edit them and include specific questions when you're looking for feedback. 

The more specific you are with your questions the more likely it is that another member of the community will give you feedback.

## Got feedback for us?

We love receiving feedback! We're always looking to improve our challenges and our platform. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email hi[at]frontendmentor[dot]io.

**Have fun building!** üöÄ

## Netlify

This starter site is configured to deploy to [Netlify Edge Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/), which means it will be rendered at an edge location near to your users.

### Local development

The [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) can be used to preview a production build locally. To do so: First build your site, then to start a local server, run:

1. Install Netlify CLI globally `npm i -g netlify-cli`.
2. Build your site with both ssr and static `npm run build`.
3. Start a local server with `npm run serve`.
   In this project, `npm run serve` uses the `netlify dev` command to spin up a server that can handle Netlify's Edge Functions locally.
4. Visit [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/) to check out your site.

### Edge Functions Declarations

[Netlify Edge Functions declarations](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/declarations/)
can be configured to run on specific URL patterns. Each edge function declaration associates
one site path pattern with one function to execute on requests that match the path. A single request can execute a chain of edge functions from a series of declarations. A single edge function can be associated with multiple paths across various declarations.

This is useful to determine if a page response should be Server-Side Rendered (SSR) or
if the response should use a static-site generated (SSG) `index.html` file instead.

By default, the Netlify Edge adaptor will generate a `.netlify/edge-middleware/manifest.json` file, which is used by the Netlify deployment to determine which paths should, and should not, use edge functions.

To override the generated manifest, you can [add a declaration](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/declarations/#add-a-declaration) to the `netlify.toml` using the `[[edge_functions]]` config. For example:

```toml
[[edge_functions]]
  path = "/admin"
  function = "auth"
```

### Addition Adapter Options

Netlify-specific option fields that can be passed to the adapter options:

- `excludedPath` this option accepts a `string` glob pattern that represents which path pattern should not go through the generated Edge Functions.

### Deployments

You can [deploy your site to Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/) either via a Git provider integration or through the Netlify CLI. This starter site includes a `netlify.toml` file to configure your build for deployment.

#### Deploying via Git

Once your site has been pushed to your Git provider, you can either link it [in the Netlify UI](https://app.netlify.com/start) or use the CLI. To link your site to a Git provider from the Netlify CLI, run the command:

```shell
netlify link
```

This sets up [continuous deployment](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#deploy-with-git) for your site's repo. Whenever you push new commits to your repo, Netlify starts the build process..

#### Deploying manually via the CLI

If you wish to deploy from the CLI rather than using Git, you can use the command:

```shell
netlify deploy --build
```

You must use the `--build` flag whenever you deploy. This ensures that the Edge Functions that this starter site relies on are generated and available when you deploy your site.

Add `--prod` flag to deploy to production.
